# VRGenerativeGeometries #

Generative geometries with TouchDesigner and HTC Vive as part of a experimentation of generative virtual reality. Inspired on Marpi's Mass Migration Builder interactive piece (https://marpi.pl/work/mass-migrations-builder/).

### Basic components ###

In order to replicate the same process to generate geometries based on the controllers position, you may only need the following components:

* OpenVR [CHOP]
* Record [CHOP]
* Geometry [COMP]

### Colaborative Virtual Reality ###

I'm currently working on a couple of researchs about changing the isolation paradigm on VR. You can check more about it on my [Medium channel](https://medium.com/@ElPepe).
